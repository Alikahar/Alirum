            Covering a small area within the Yarra Ranges National Park, about a 10 minute drive from the town of Warburton, the forest of exotic pines was planted by the Board of Works in about 1930, meaning the trees are nearing a century of growth.

            The Californian Redwoods (Sequoia sempervirens), the tallest tree species in the world, have here grown to about 50m, though in their native forests in North America with a few more centuries under their belt they can reach heights of 115 metres.

            One of the most interesting things about a visit is seeing how the introduced species have impacted the landscape. Native eucalypt species, cleared to make way for the plantings, still surround the forest and soften the edges - allowing light and other species to thrive.

            This walk takes you through the pine forest, down to the banks of Cement Creek, up to a clearing and then back around the edges of the pine forest to the entry and car park area.
